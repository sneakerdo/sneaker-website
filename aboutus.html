<h1>About us</h1> 
<p>Description: Buy, sell, and trade sneaker without any worry of not getting your end of the deal. The sneaker market is a billion dollar market and it needs a website that could feed those that want a piece of the market and everything it has to offer from its money to the sneakers itself. In this website there will be a middleman that makes sure that the product is 100% authentic and make sure fellow sneakerheads sleep good at night. There will also be security code  on the  website to make sure nothing happens to the funds in the deal. This website also identifies whether a trade or sell is a great deal or bad deal which separates itself from other websites such as ebay, and other sneaker reseller websites.</p>
